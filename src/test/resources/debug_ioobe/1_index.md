## Overview
MELT is a powerful maven framework for developing, tuning, evaluating, and packaging ontology matching systems.
It is optimized to be used in [OAEI](http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/) campaigns and allows to submit matchers to the SEALS and HOBBIT evaluation platform easily. 
MELT can also be used for non OAEI-related matching tasks and evaluation.

## Code Examples
The [examples folder](https://github.com/dwslab/melt/tree/master/examples) contains reference examples that you can use to better understand how MELT can be used for different tasks and that can be used as barebone project for specific applications. The examples are also referenced in the user guide here.

## Code Documentation / JavaDoc
The MELT code is extensively documented using JavaDoc which is also published online:
- [Latest Commit / Development Version](/javadoc_latest/index.html)
- [Releases](https://javadoc.io/doc/de.uni-mannheim.informatik.dws.melt)

## Modules Overview
MELT is grouped into multiple maven modules which are described below.

### matching-base
Contains the basic interfaces to implement a matcher e.g. MatcherURL.

### matching-eval
Contains various tools to evaluate the performance of matchers and to analyze their result.

### matching-jena
Contains [Jena-based](https://jena.apache.org/) classes related to matcher development as well as additional services such as caching of source and target ontologies.  

### matching-jena-matchers
Contains modularized matchers that can be used to quickly assemble matching systems. Note that it is possible to easily chain those matchers building a matching pipeline.

### matching-ml
The machine learning extension for MELT. The ML extension allows communicating with a Python backend.
Currently, [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) is supported. The module also contains a client to consume
<a href="http://kgvec2go.org/">KGvec2go</a> vectors.

### matching-owlapi
Contains OWL-API-based classes related to matcher development as well as additional services such as caching of source and target ontologies.  

### matching-validation
Contains various validation services to validate new tracks and test cases. Validation includes parseability by multiple libraries using different releases and further checks.

### hobbit-wrapper
Contains a wrapper for HOBBIT platform (implements the interface used in HOBBIT and transforms the calls to MatcherURL interface).

### hobbit-maven-plugin
Maven Plugin for creating a container for the [HOBBIT platform](https://project-hobbit.eu/outcomes/hobbit-platform/).

### receivers
Contains utilities to wrap a matcher to a specific interface such as HTTP, SEALS, HOBBIT etc.
